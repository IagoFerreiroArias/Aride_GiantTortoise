### Individual-based networks reveal turnover of individual ecological roles of giant tortoises across ecological processes with diverging outcomes.

Our study explores the ecological role of reintroduced Aldabra giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) on Aride Island (Seychelles), where they 
perform key non-redundant functions in seed dispersal, vegetation control, and nutrient cycling. Given the islandâ€™s highly simplified frugivore 
and detritivore assemblages, the Aldabra giant tortoise stands as the only browser-grazer, playing a unique and irreplaceable role in maintaining 
ecosystem dynamics. Despite the well-recognised role of giant tortoises in ecological restoration, there is a lack of scientific knowledge 
regarding individual variability in their ecological functions. Previous studies have mainly focused on their herbivory and detritivory, while their
contribution to seed dispersal and the extent to which individual differences influence diverse ecological processes remain largely unexplored. 
Moreover, the restoration of ecological interactions with both native and introduced plant species on islands like Aride has not been thoroughly assessed.

By employing traditional techniques such as focal observations and faeces examination together with state-of-art DNA metabarcoding techniques and 
data-merging approaches, we build up three individual-based networks for three different ecological processes mediated by individual giant tortoises 
but with diverging interaction outcomes for plant species: detritivory (commensalism), browsing and grazing (antagonism) and frugivory and seed dispersal
(mutualism). We estimated the effectiveness of giant tortoises following the Seed Dispersal Effectiveness framework on each ecological processes taking 
into account the proportion of native and exotic flora dispersed or consumed and further assessed changes in topological and structural roles of 
individual tortoises across the three individual-based networks. 

Our findings reveal substantial individual variation in the ecological roles of reintroduced Aldabra giant tortoises, with differences in their 
effectiveness across detritivory, browsing-grazing, and seed dispersal for both native and exotic flora. While a few individuals played a key role in all 
three processes, they represented only a small percentage of the population. Most tortoises exhibited varying levels of effectiveness depending on the 
ecological process, highlighting the dynamic and context-dependent nature of their functional contributions. Additionally, network analyses showed that 
the majority of individuals maintained peripheral structural roles, with only one acting as a hub, further emphasizing the non-uniform importance of 
certain individuals on ecosystem processes. Individual topological shifts underscore the potential for some individuals to contribute disproportionately 
to certain functions while being less effective in others, which may have implications for the robustness of ecological networks, as the disappearance of 
an individual could significantly impact one ecological process while having little effect on another. Yet, the observation that a single individual may 
fulfil similar structural roles in different ecological processes carry significant ecological implications, especially for those processes governed by 
keystone species with small population sizes such as Aldabra giant tortoises in Aride Island. For instance, individuals with relevant structural roles 
across different ecological processes, may hold disproportionate ecological importance, as their loss can trigger the propagation of perturbations across 
multiple and diverging ecological processes.
